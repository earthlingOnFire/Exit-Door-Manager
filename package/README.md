WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?
- This mod allows you to change where the exit door of a level leads. For example, you can change the exit of Level 7-4 to lead to Level 0-1 or perhaps Level P-1. 
- You can also use this mod to skip the intermission cutscenes at the end of each act by making 3-2's exit lead directly to 4-1 and 6-2's exit to 7-1.
- There is also the option to make the destination random.

HOW DO I CONFIGURE THE MOD?
- Go into Options.
- Go into "PLUGIN CONFIG" (top left corner).
- Select "Exit Door Manager"
- For every level exit in the game, there is a dropdown you can use to select where the exit leads.

HOW DO I INSTALL THIS MOD MANUALLY?
- First, ensure BepInEx and PluginConfigurator are installed. 
- Then, drag the "ExitDoorManager" folder to the BepInEx/plugins folder in your game files.
